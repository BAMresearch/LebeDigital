\subsection{Homogenized Concrete Parameters}
Experimental data generally provided for concrete material research includes measurements both on concrete and on cement specimens.
For the data regarded within this work, the measurements of compressive strength are performed on concrete, the calorimetry on cement samples.
Properties of the aggregates are available regardless of the cement.\\

To be able to take concrete as well as cement data into account, an analytical homogenization procedure is used.
This allows for a continuous optimization of the aggregate amount, requiring few experimental data points.
The effective concrete properties that are homogenized are the Young's modulus $\eMod$, the Poission's ratio $\poission$, the compressive strength $\fc$, the density $\density$, the thermal conductivity $\thermCond$, the heat capacity $\heatCapSpecific$ and the total heat release $\heatInf$.
Depending on the physical meaning, these properties need different methods to estimate the effective concrete properties.
To visualize the qualitative effect of the amount of aggregates within the concrete, effective properties are plotted for aggregate values from 0 to 1, respectively pure cement to only aggregates.
Note that both extremes are purely numerical results.
%Due to the chosen homogenization method, values of aggregates above ??? should be considered nonphysical (????).
\mbox{Table \ref{tab:homogenizationproperties}} gives an overview of the material properties of the constituents used in the subsequent simple examples.
For the considered example properties, the relations are close to linear, this can change, when more complex micro mechanical mechanisms are incorporated as air pores or the interfacial transition zone.
These can be considered within the chosen homogenization scheme by adding with further phases.
The required data for a meaningful calibration is however out of the scope of the available data.

The elastic, isotropic properties $\eMod$ and $\poission$ of the concrete are approximated using the Mori-Tanaka homogenization scheme \cite{mor_1973_asi}.
The method assumes spherical inclusions in an infinite matrix and considers the interactions of multiple inclusions.\\
The estimation of the concrete compressive strength $\fcEff$ follows the ideas of \cite{nev_2018_mcam}.
The assumption is that a failure in the cement paste will cause the concrete to crack.
The approach is based on two main assumptions.
First, the Mori-Tanaka method is used to estimate the average stress within the matrix material $\stressMatrix$. 
Second, the von Mises failure criterion of the average matrix stress is used to estimate the uniaxial compressive strength.
The effects shown in Figure \ref{fig:homogenization} depends on the difference between the Young's modulus of the paste and the aggregates.
Homogenization of the thermal conductivity is also generally based on the Mori-Tanaka method, following the ideas of \cite{str_2011_mbeo}.
The remaining quantities can be directly computed based on their volume average.
This is the case for density $\density$, the heat capacity $\heatCapSpecific$ and the total heat release $\heatInf$.
As example the heat release is shown in Figure \ref{fig:homogenization} as it exemplifies the expected linear relation of the volume average as well as the zero heat output of a theoretical pure aggregate..
