\subsubsection{Beam design according to EC2}
To ensure that the chosen mix and beam properties fulfill the requirements according to the European norm for reinforced concrete, \cite{DIN1992-1-1}, the computation of the required steel reinforcement is integrated into the workflow.
For a given beam height, load and compressive strength, the minimum required cross section of the steel reinforcement is computed.
The results for example parameters, given in Table \ref{tab:beamdesigninput}, are visualized in Figure \ref{fig:beamdesign}.
To ensure that this design is realistic, the continuous cross section is transformed into a discrete number of bars, with a diameter chosen from a list.
This is visible in Figure \ref{fig:beamdesign} by the step-wise increase in cross sections.
The admissible results are restricted by two constrains.
One is coming from a minimal required compressive strength, visualized as dashed line.
The other, based on the available space to place bars with admissible spacing, visualized as the dotted line.
Further detail on the computation are given in Appendix \ref{appendix:beam}.
