\subsection{Beam design according to EC2}
To ensure that the chosen mix and beam properties fulfill the requirements according to the European norm for reinforced concrete, \cite{DIN1992-1-1}, the computation of the required steel reinforcement is integrated into the workflow.
For a given beam height, load and compressive strength, the minimum required cross section of the steel reinforcement is computed \eqref{eq:Areq}.
The results for example parameters, given in Table \ref{tab:beamdesigninput}, are visualized in Figure \ref{fig:beamdesign}.
To ensure that this design is realistic, the continuous cross section is transformed into a discrete number of bars, with a diameter chosen from a list.
This is visible in Figure \ref{fig:beamdesign} by the step-wise increase in cross sections.
The admissible results are restricted by two constrains.
One is coming from a minimal required compressive strength \eqref{eq:constraintfc}, visualized as dashed line.
The other, based on the available space to place bars with admissible spacing \eqref{eq:constraintGeo}, visualized as the dotted line.
Further detail on the computation are given in Appendix \ref{appendix:beam}.
