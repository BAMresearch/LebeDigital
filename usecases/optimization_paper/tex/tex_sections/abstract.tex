\abstract{
Concrete is a highly complex heterogeneous material.
Not only are the effective mechanical properties highly dependent on various factors, as for example aggregate type, water content or additives, but the properties change over time and the evolution of properties is in turn dependent on the specific mix design of the concrete.
This is already a challenge in it self when only dealing with concrete properties.
To ... something about structural design... connecting them...
By applying .... stochastic methods, the quality of the data can be estimated.
Automated workflow to simplify addition of additional data points and general reproducibility.}
