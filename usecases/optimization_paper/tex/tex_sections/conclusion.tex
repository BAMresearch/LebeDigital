Here is an empty file as example to start the conclusion section.


The using the FEM model to estimate demolding time has multiple advantages.
It is allows to take changing material properties into account when optimizing the mix properties.
The applied constraint, although quite crude, show the improvement over a priory defined compressive strength requirement, as is the state of the art for mayn precast concrete manufacturers.
