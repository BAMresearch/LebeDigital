Here is an empty file as example to start the conclusion section.


The using the FEM model to estimate demolding time has multiple advantages.
It is allows to take changing material properties into account when optimizing the mix properties.
The applied constraint, although quite crude, show the improvement over a priory defined compressive strength requirement, as is the state of the art for mayn precast concrete manufacturers.



In view of the various substitutes to OPC, this framework aims to show a possibility to run a optimization on the precast concrete part by including the mix design as parameters.
This framework allows to modularly include other aspects, as for example the workability or air content.
In addition models can be easily replaced by others, without need of changing the structure or the optimization method.
