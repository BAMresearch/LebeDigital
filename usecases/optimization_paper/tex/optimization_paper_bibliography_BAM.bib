@phdthesis{gruyaert2011,
	abstract     = {{Sustainability is getting more and more attention during the last years. Also in the concrete and cement industry, attempts are made to minimize the environmental impact. One way to implement this thought, is the use of industrial by-products as cement replacing material. The 'waste' products are upgraded in high-value applications and the need for clinker is reduced. As a consequence, the CO2 emissions and energy demands associated with the clinker production are reduced. This PhD thesis focuses on the use of blast-furnace slag (BFS) as cement replacing material.
	Blast-furnace slag, a by-product of the steel production, obtains latent-hydraulic properties after rapid cooling and can thus replace clinker in cement. In EN 197-1 (2000), three types of slag cements are defined : CEM III/A (36 - 65 % BFS), CEM III/B (66 - 80 % BFS) and CEM III/C (81 - 95 % BFS)). More recently, in Belgium slag having a technical approval with certification can also be added to the concrete mix as a separate component if combined with an Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) CEM I having a strength class of 42.5 or higher. In 2004, the k-value concept for granulated blast-furnace slag was implemented in the national application document of EN 206-1 (2000). NBN B15-001 (2004) describes the rules which should be applied. Summarizing, the k-value for BFS amounts to 0.9 and the maximum slag content which may be taken into account in the k-values concept is limited (slag-to-cement ratio <= 0.45 or 0.2 depending on the exposure conditions and (prestressed) reinforcement.}},
