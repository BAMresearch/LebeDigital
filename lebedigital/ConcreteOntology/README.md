## CPTO
The Concrete Production and Testing Ontology (CPTO) is created in the project LeBeDigital.
## MiWoEx
The ontology for the minimun working example is illustrated in the file MiWoEx.drawio. 
It contains different parts of the process chain of concrete production (in detail: mix design, heat of hydration, flow table, compressive strength and youngs modulus).
